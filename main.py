    The code works in 6 cycles, updating the rest hours & current mission of each soldier on duty. This will be done by calling in a specific function several times.
    The aim is to make sure the soldiers don't do more than 4/8 or 8/8. Doing 4/8 reduces 3 resting points (1 for the 4 hours of guarding and 2 for the 8 hours of rest),
    while 'siur' and 'hamal' give 4 (same logic). The program will attempt to have everyone's average the same number so everything is equal. The focus is not to make a complete
    'shavtzak', but to aid to the sergeants in making a shavtzak which they can alter, saving them time.
